# Combat Design
## Challenging combat
- taking a hit is devastating, single enemy can kill you especially at the beginning. Which leads to the sense of scalability and emerging.

## Attacking
- Sprint attacks can catch enemies off gaurd if you move in quickly enough. Indicated by a ! over their heads as you sprint into their sight range

## Blocking & dodging
- you can block with sword, but it is directional (limited angle, because its strong), and some things can't be blocked. No stamina - remember the power fantasy, you feel awesome when you block
- Because blocking is strong, dodging is less so than in some games. You can dodge by jumping, but there are no i-frames. Some attacks are not jump-able, only blockable. A jump feels awesome due to the agile side-dodge like animation. Or head first dive-flip animation if not side-stepping. Jump attacks are awesome power sweep slams
- Blocking has a recovery time for a blocked attack, during which you cannot move or attack (but subsequent attacks are still blocked). Jumping has the advantage of countering quicker with a jump attack, but its less general purpose for avoiding damage, and harder to pull off
- If the reward is found, perfectly timed block gives a clang effect and puts you in a block/windup for attack stance. You will block subsequent attacks, and if you attack within 1 or 2 s the attack will do extra damage

## Scale
- 1v1s in beginning, but by the mid-end of a run you are fighting entire armies. I mean hundreds of enemies. It is not fair. But you can become very op
- Only Sword combat
    - the idea is make one combat system, which can scale and balance much easier. Art becomes easier too, animations reduced drastically. Can really polish the combat. This makes the games combat stand out from anything else

## Cinema
- Cinematic camera movements and killmoves - not too difficult but lots of payoff in feel
- A perfectly timed jump still gives no i-frames, but you do a backflip with a brief slo-mo effect

## Staggering and stun locking
- All enemies have a poise bar. Most of them are simply 1 poise, which is the default sword's poise damage.
- Most enemies are staggerred when they get hit, which has a brief stun where they can't do anything
- Goddess and semi-bosses will have a poise that allows you to stagger them if you are aggressive. When they get staggered, they are stunned a bit longer to let you get some hits in

## Running from combat
- This is not a game about realistic strategy or what is best. Its a game about power fantasy and being a bad ass. Running is possible only if you have the sprint button. Otherwise you can't outrun the enemies.
